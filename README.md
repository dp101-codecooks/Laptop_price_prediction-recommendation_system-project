# Laptop Price Predictor

## Project Overview
The Laptop Price Predictor is a machine learning-based application designed to estimate the market price of laptops based on their specifications. This tool helps buyers make informed decisions and allows sellers to price their products competitively. The Phase 1 implementation focuses on data collection, basic modeling, and a simple interface.

## Phase 1 Features Implemented
- Data collection and preprocessing of laptop specifications
- Feature selection and engineering for relevant attributes
- Implementation of regression models for price prediction
- Basic command-line interface for user input and predictions
- Evaluation metrics to measure model performance

## Technology Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Data Handling: CSV/JSON for data storage
- Version Control: Git

## Installation Instructions
1. Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed on your system
2. Clone the repository to your local machine
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt
4. Install required dependencies using: pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Run the application using: python main.py

## Usage Guide
1. Launch the application from the command line
2. Follow the prompts to enter laptop specifications
3. The system will display the predicted price based on your inputs
4. Optional: Provide actual price for model performance feedback

## Dataset Information
The initial dataset includes key laptop attributes:
- Processor type and speed
- RAM capacity
- Storage type and size
- Display specifications
- Brand information
- Graphics card details

## Current Models Implemented
- Linear Regression baseline model
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Model performance comparison metrics

## Phase 1 Limitations
- Limited dataset size and features
- Basic command-line interface only
- Prediction accuracy may vary for uncommon configurations
- No persistent data storage between sessions

## Future Enhancements
- Web-based graphical user interface
- Expanded dataset with more features and entries
- Additional regression models and ensemble methods
- Price comparison with online marketplaces
- User accounts for saving preferences and search history
